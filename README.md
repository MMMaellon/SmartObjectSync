# SmartObjectSync

## Ask questions on my Discord Server: <https://discord.gg/S5sDC4PnFp>

A drop-in replacement for VRC_ObjectSync that allows for better syncing of objects in VRChat. Demo video here: https://twitter.com/MMMaellon/status/1614152548780478464

Just add SmartObjectSync to your object and hit the setup button if you see one. Setup button only appears if the auto-setup fails or if you change other components that would affect how SmartObjectSync works.

## Install

### The cool way
Go to <https://mmmaellon.github.io/MMMaellonVCCListing/> and click "Add to VCC"
Then click Manage Project on your project in VCC and press the plus button next to SmartObjectSync

### The lame way
Navigate to <https://github.com/MMMaellon/SmartObjectSync/releases> and download the latest .unitypackage
Double-click the .unitypackage with your Unity Project open to import it.

## Examples

You install SmartObjectSync the cool way or just clone this whole git repo to get access to the example scenes.
Then open the Example Scenes by following these steps:

1. Window > Package Manager
2. Set the drop-down in the top left to "In Project" and select SmartObjectSync under the "custom" category
3. Import one of the example scenes
